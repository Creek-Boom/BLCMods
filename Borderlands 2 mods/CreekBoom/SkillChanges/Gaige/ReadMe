Interspersed Outburst : Added 5% weapon swap speed per point.

Death From Above : Multiply it's damage by 10, you can proc it every 20 seconds to compensate.

----Note : 

----I couldn't reduce the number of consumed stacks, I can change the number on the description but not the actual consumption. 
----If I figure this out or someone has an idea on how to do it, let me know . I had different plans for this skill :)

----Huge credit to AutumnWitch, check out her (?) Gaige rework mods :)

Rational Anarchist : Gives you 50 stacks instead of 25.
