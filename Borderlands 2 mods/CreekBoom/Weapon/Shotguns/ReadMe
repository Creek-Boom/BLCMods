Carnage : Gave it grenade damage

Twister : 1) It's main elements comes in slag, shock, fire and corrosive, 2) You have the option to choose it's splash damage for your dual elements : fire, slag, shock, corrosive or explosive.
          3) The full explosive variant is an exception, it comes in explosive main element only.

----Note : 
    1) I suggest disabling sanity check via HexMultiTool, so you don't have to re-gibbed your twisters every time you change some options.
    2) If you want to have explosive boost (relics etc) with the full explosive one, make sure that you are using your non-elemental twister.

---- Gibbed Codes : 
---- Fire : BL2(hwAAAAAFKgQACIEJB6HVrkBRg4KBMgEKGxQLKBJQ/v9noByDcoHy)
---- Corrosive : BL2(hwAAAAC7FgQACIEJB6HVrkBRg4KBMgEKG5QLKBJQ/v9noByDcoHy)
---- Slag : BL2(hwAAAAB0GwQACIEJB6HVrkBRg4KBMgEKG5QMKBJQ/v9noByDcoHy)
---- Explosive : BL2(hwAAAADHbwQACIEJB6HVrkBRg4KBMgEKG5QKKBJQ/v9noByDcoHy)

---- If you want full fire or full corrosive or full slag directly, check out KuroPanther_M twister mods :)
---- I precise it because this farm takes time, and with 4 differents elements to farm for this is insanely RNG based.
---- Also I wanted to thanks KuroPanther_M for his twister mods :)
