Godfinger : Added shock, fire and corrosive elements.

---- Gibbed codes : 

---- Shock : BL2(hwAAAADxVAqEKIAAB6HVLgBcAEMA0AXMBJgbMGRg/v8XAHQEMwDw)
---- Fire : BL2(hwAAAABPaAqEKIAAB6HVLgBcAEMA0AXMBBgbMGRg/v8XAHQEMwDw)
---- Corrosive : BL2(hwAAAACAZQqEKIAAB6HVLgBcAEMA0AXMBBgcMGRg/v8XAHQEMwDw)

Patriot : Same buffs as UCP, grants sniper ammo regen while holding it.

---- Note : While the patriot is interesting and is indeed a good sniper rifle, the lyudmila is so strong that it overshadows it.
            It is still underperforming compared to the lyudmila, but it now has a little tweak for itself.
