Gaige : Class Mods Changes

Legendary Catalyst : Inverted the hidden minimal accuracy nerf : now gives you ~+35% min accuracy and appears on the card's stat list.
Legendary Chaos : Sort of a legendary Tiny Tina's COM. Gives you critical damage, reload speed and fire rate like the vanilla Tina's COM.
