Without knowing anything about mods nor coding, 
I've gradually learned about how to edit some of the code in BLCMM thanks to all of the community. (UCP, and all players who've posted on this github and other sources over the years :D)
Just to say that you can do it too, try watching videos about BLCMM editing if you want to start, and check how the modders have changed the line of code through BLCMM :)
Just a quick disclaimer I'm still a noob in coding / modding.

Huge thanks to everyone, 
I wanted to try new changes for fun in this beautiful game that is BL2, and you guys made this possible for me ! :D

I try not to overtune my mods, 
I did include some pretty strong gear though. Just to have fun :)

If I've misspelled some words : I'm sorry I'm french (yes baguette croissant) :P

Lastly, I hope that you'll enjoy "my" mods !
Have fun everyone :D
