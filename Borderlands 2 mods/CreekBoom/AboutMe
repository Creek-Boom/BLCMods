Without knowing anything about mods, I've gradually learned about how to edit the code in BLCMM thanks to all the modders (UCP, and all players who've posted on this github).
Huge thanks to everyone, I don't know much but I did improve over the months to make some changes I wanted to try for fun in this beautiful game that is BL2. :)
I try not to overtune my mods, I enjoy balance even if the game is pretty easy excluding raid bosses.
If I've misspelled some words : I'm sorry I'm a french noob :P
