Without knowing anything about mods nor coding, 
I've gradually learned about how to edit the code in BLCMM thanks to all the modders.
(UCP, and all players who've posted on this github over the years :D)

Huge thanks to everyone, 
I wanted to try new changes for fun in this beautiful game that is BL2, and you guys made this possible for me ! :D

I try not to overtune my mods, 
I appreciate balance even if the game is pretty easy excluding raid bosses.

If I've misspelled some words : I'm sorry I'm a french noob :P

Lastly, I hope that you'll enjoy the mods I've "created" !
Have fun everyone :D
