Without knowing anything about mods, 
I've gradually learned about how to edit the code in BLCMM thanks to all the modders.
(UCP, and all players who've posted on this github over the years :D)

Huge thanks to everyone, 
I don't know much about coding, but I did improve over the months to make some changes I wanted to try for fun in this beautiful game that is BL2.
I hope that you'll enjoy them as well :D

I try not to overtune my mods, 
I appreciate balance even if the game is pretty easy excluding raid bosses.

If I've misspelled some words : I'm sorry I'm a french noob :P
