Without knowing anything about mods nor coding, 
I've gradually learned about how to edit some of the code in BLCMM thanks to all the modders : UCP, and all players who've posted on this github over the years :D.
Just to say that you can do it too, it takes a little  time to figure out though ^^

Huge thanks to everyone, 
I wanted to try new changes for fun in this beautiful game that is BL2, and you guys made this possible for me ! :D

I try not to overtune my mods, 
I do included some pretty strong, borderline cheated changes though.

If I've misspelled some words : I'm sorry I'm a french noob :P

Lastly, I hope that you'll enjoy the mods I've "created" !
Have fun everyone :D
